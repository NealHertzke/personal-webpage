# Project 
User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project
(basis for my Portfolio website)

### Getting Started
Run the project1.html file using c9, It will link you to the homepage directly.

### Function
This page is designed to be a directory for my personal information, including links to my cv, portfolio, the aim for me was to make all the functions work,
so that every link would be directed to the correct place, the home function to be working and the resume page to be a "placeholder for another page".
I used css bootstrap to create all the buttons and connecting to the correct places, while also structuring the style/layout of the page.

### Tests
I used google webdeveloper toolkit to find any inaccuracies in the code, where certain buttons were not directly connecting, 
I had to get the right link and coded in correctly to get the buttons all working.

### Design/structure
I used colors that are appealing to me, and I felt would give a unique vibe to my website. The black, grey, and white is meant to balance itself, 
while the dashes of purple are meant to grab the users attention, mainly used for buttons or bulletpoints.
I also used grey to divide the header from the center and the footer.

### Acknowledgements
Platforms such as facebook, twitter, linkedin, pinterest, and youtube were used for my pages links to be able to reach me on those mediums.
The cloud image i used comes from an animated series, but I adjusted it and changed the color accordingly to fit with my website design layout.
The pdf sample, is one of my outdated CVs will be replaced with a more accurate one in the future, as i intend to adjust the website to my personal needs.
